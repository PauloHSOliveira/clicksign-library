# ClickSign Library (Node.js)

This is a Node.js library to facilitate contract sending using the ClickSign REST API. The library is written in TypeScript and uses functional programming to provide an easy-to-use and scalable interface.

## Implemented Features

The library already has the following features implemented:

- Send contracts to ClickSign
- Retrieve the list of documents in ClickSign

## How to Use

### Installation

To use the library in your Node.js project, you can install it via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install clicksign-library --save
```

or
```bash
yarn add clicksign-library
```

Configuration
Before using the library, you need to configure the ClickSign API with your access key, and the enviroment:

```typescript
import { createClickSignAPI, ClickSignEnvironment } from 'clicksign-library';

const accessToken = 'YOUR_CLICKSIGN_ACCESS_KEY';
const clickSignAPI = createClickSignAPI({
    accessToken,
    environment: ClickSignEnvironment.Sandbox,
});
```

Send Contract
To send a contract to ClickSign, you can use the sendDocument function:

```typescript
import { sendDocument } from 'clicksign-library';

// Contract data
const contractData = {
  filename: 'contract.pdf',
  content: 'BASE64_ENCODED_CONTRACT_CONTENT',
  signers: [
    {
      email: 'signer1@example.com',
      name: 'Signer 1',
      // Other signer information...
    },
    // Add more signers if needed...
  ],
};

// Send the contract to ClickSign
const document = await sendDocument(clickSignAPI, contractData);
console.log('Contract sent:', document);
```

List Documents
To retrieve the list of documents in ClickSign, you can use the getDocuments function:

```typescript
import { getDocuments } from 'clicksign-library';

// Get the list of documents
const documents = await getDocuments(clickSignAPI);
console.log('Documents:', documents);
```
